# Day 1 morning

## Negative

- I missed a brief overview of all kinds of Carpentries' courses provide (a commend from instructors: we actually did not do it at all)
- I found it hard to enagge with the concept maps and how to use them in my domain
- Need more concept map practice (happy to do in own time)
- Notes on the Google notes are less visially appeaking than the github page but I understand the merit of the collaborative doc
- Not a huge fan of Google docs
- Encourages open thinking which can lead to mind wondering...
- Needed little more clarification on some of the exercises
- Faded examples harder to apply to exercises with a small number of stages
- Maybe having a live feedback thing like sli.do during the session would be good
- Couldn't fo faded example - came prepared to do OpenRefine example.
